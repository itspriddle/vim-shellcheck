# vim-shellcheck

Vim wrapper for [ShellCheck][], a static analysis tool for shell scripts.

[ShellCheck]: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck

## Commands

These commands are available in buffers with `'filetype'` of `sh`.

```
:[range]ShellCheck[!] [args]
```

Run `shellcheck` for the current buffer using optional `[args]` and send any
errors to the quickfix-window. Specify a `[range]` or use a visual selection
to check only those lines, otherwise the entire buffer is checked. Call with a
bang to automatically open the quickfix-window when errors are found.

```
:[range]LShellCheck[!] [args]
```

Run `shellcheck` for the current buffer using optional `[args]` and send any
errors to a location-list-window. Specify a `[range]` or use a visual
selection to check only those lines, otherwise the entire buffer is checked.
Call with a bang to automatically open the location-list-window when errors
are found.

## QF Mappings

**Open ShellCheck error definition on GitHub - gb**

The `gb` command can be used quickfix or location list windows to open the
ShellCheck error definition on GitHub. This command requires the Netrw plugin
to be installed. If Netrw is not installed, the `gb` map prints the URL to the
ShellCheck error definition on GitHub instead. This functionality is enabled
when the window's `w:quickfix_title` attribute starts with one of the
following:

- `:shellcheck` -- created by `compiler shellcheck | :make %` or some other
  program
- `:ShellCheck` -- created by the `:ShellCheck` command
- `:LShellCheck` -- created by the `:LShellCheck` command

To disable this mapping:

```viml
let g:shellcheck_disable_mappings = 1
```

To setup a different map:

```viml
let g:shellcheck_disable_mappings = 1
autocmd FileType qf nmap <buffer> <silent> gB <Plug>(shellcheck-gb)
```

Note: The `gb` map will not be defined if one already exists.

## Compiler

A ShellCheck `:compiler` is provided by Vim 8.2.1769 and newer for use as a
`'makeprg'`. To use it, run:

```
:compiler shellcheck
:make! %
:copen
```

## Configuration

**`g:shellcheck_qf_open`**

Specifies how the quickfix-window is opened when `:ShellCheck!` is used. The
default value is `"botright copen 10"`.

**`g:shellcheck_ll_open`**

Specifies how the location-list-window is opened when `:LShellCheck!` is used.
The default value is `"lopen 10"`.
